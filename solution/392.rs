/**
 * [91] Decode Ways
 *
 * A message containing letters from A-Z is being encoded to numbers using the following mapping:
 *
 *
 * 'A' -> 1
 * 'B' -> 2
 * ...
 * 'Z' -> 26
 *
 *
 * Given a non-empty string containing only digits, determine the total number of ways to decode it.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: "12"
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: It could be decoded as "AB" (1 2) or "L" (12).
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 * Input: "226"
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: It could be decoded as "BZ" (2 26), "VF" (22 6), or "BBF" (2 2 6).
